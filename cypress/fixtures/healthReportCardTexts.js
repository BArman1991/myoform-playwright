export const antioxidantText = `Antioxidants are crucial compounds that help neutralize free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause oxidative stress, cellular damage, and inflammation. Oxidative stress is linked to aging, chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer), and impaired recovery from exercise. Key dietary antioxidants include vitamins A, C, and E, carotenoids (e.g., beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene), phenolic compounds (found in fruits, vegetables, and teas), and trace minerals such as selenium and zinc, which act as cofactors for antioxidant enzymes. Genetic variations influence how well the body produces, utilizes, and recycles antioxidants, affecting individual requirements for dietary intake and supplementation.Our genes play a role in how much 'oxidation' occurs and therefore the potential for damage to our tissues. Those that have a high oxidation rate may benefit from consuming greater quantities of antioxidants. Based on your genetic data information, you may have a higher antioxidant requirement than normal.`;
export const caffeineTest = ` Caffeine is the most widely consumed stimulant in the world, naturally found in coffee beans, tea leaves, cacao, and other plants. As a methylxanthine, caffeine works by blocking adenosine receptors, which reduces fatigue and enhances alertness. It also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, preventing the breakdown of cyclic AMP (cAMP), which plays a key role in energy production and fat metabolism. However, genetic variations influence how quickly caffeine is metabolized, affecting both sensitivity and tolerance.Our genes can play a role in the rate in which we metabolise caffeine, the single gene below is responsible for around 95% of all caffeine metabolism in the body. Based on your genetic data information, you may have a moderate sensitivity to caffeine compared to normal.`
