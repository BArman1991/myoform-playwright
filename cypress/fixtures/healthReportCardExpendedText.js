Superoxide dismutaseRS IDrs4880GENOTYPEAGSuperoxide dismutase is an enzyme that protects cells from increased oxidative stress and free radical damage to cell structures like membranes, mitochondria, DNA and proteins. SOD2 rs4880 is sensitive to inadequate antioxidant intake including environmental exposures that relate to ROS production such as smoking and environmental toxins.GENEACTN3 - Alpha Actinin 3RS IDrs1815739GENOTYPETTAssociated with major structural component of the fast twitch fibres of skeletal muscles. Only present in fast twitch muscle fibres.GENESLC23A1 - Sodium-Dependent Vitamin C Transporter 1 (SVCT1)RS IDrs33972313GENOTYPECCL-ascorbic acid is obtained from the diet and is transported across the cell membrane, including intestinal cells, through both facilitated and active modes of transport. The active transport is achieved by sodium L-ascorbic acid (“vitamin C”) co-transporters (SVCTs) which transport ascorbate into the cell. SVCT1 has been implicated in the absorption of dietary L-ascorbic acid across the intestinal barrier, but this work has highlighted the role of SVCT1 in kidney based reabsorption(24-26). As a result, SVCT1 is primarily involved in whole body homeostasis and transport of L-ascorbic acid and SVCT2 is primarily involved in the regulation of L-ascorbic acid in specific metabolically active tissuesWhat does this mean? How can you action this idea?Personalised RecommendationsPrioritize antioxidant-rich foods (e.g., berries, dark chocolate, turmeric, green tea, nuts, and deep-colored vegetables).Supplementation is strongly recommended to ensure optimal recovery and metabolic function.Key supplements to consider include Vitamin C and E (for immune support and oxidative stress reduction), Curcumin and resveratrol (for inflammation control and recovery), and Selenium and zinc (to enhance antioxidant enzyme function).What This Means For YouYour genetic profile suggests that you require a significantly higher intake of dietary antioxidants, meaning your body may struggle to neutralize oxidative stress efficiently, making antioxidant intake a crucial part of your diet and recovery strategy.You may have a higher propensity for oxidative stress and inflammation, especially following intense exercise or prolonged physical activity.Your genetic variations suggest that your body may not produce or recycle antioxidants as efficiently, increasing the need for external dietary support.Why This MattersAthletes with high oxidative stress levels may struggle with prolonged muscle soreness and slower recovery—addressing this through nutrition and supplementation can significantly enhance performance.Proper antioxidant intake can support endurance, strength, and injury prevention, particularly for those engaging in high-volume or high-intensity training.Work with a nutrition professional or monitor oxidative stress markers to fine-tune antioxidant intake for optimal recovery and cellular function.
