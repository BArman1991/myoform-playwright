    name: "Antioxidant Requirement",
    text: "Antioxidants are crucial compounds that help neutralize free radicals, which are unstable molecules that can cause oxidative stress, cellular damage, and inflammation. Oxidative stress is linked to aging, chronic diseases (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer), and impaired recovery from exercise. Key dietary antioxidants include vitamins A, C, and E, carotenoids (e.g., beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene), phenolic compounds (found in fruits, vegetables, and teas), and trace minerals such as selenium and zinc, which act as cofactors for antioxidant enzymes. Genetic variations influence how well the body produces, utilizes, and recycles antioxidants, affecting individual requirements for dietary intake and supplementation.Our genes play a role in how much 'oxidation' occurs and therefore the potential for damage to our tissues. Those that have a high oxidation rate may benefit from consuming greater quantities of antioxidants. Based on your genetic data information, you may have a higher antioxidant requirement than normal.",

The active transport is achieved by sodium L-ascorbic acid (“vitamin C”) co-transporters (SVCTs) which transport ascorbate into the cell. SVCT1 has been implicated in the absorption of dietary L-ascorbic acid across the intestinal barrier, but this work has highlighted the role of SVCT1 in kidney based reabsorption(24-26). As a result, SVCT1 is primarily involved in whole body homeostasis and transport of L-ascorbic acid and SVCT2 is primarily involved in the regulation of L-ascorbic acid in specific metabolically active tissuesWhat does this mean?

However, genetic variations influence how quickly caffeine is metabolized, affecting both sensitivity and tolerance.Our genes can play a role in the rate in which we metabolise caffeine, the single gene below is responsible for around 95% of all caffeine metabolism in the body.

In this way it regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism. The SNP tested changes the amino acid at position 12 in the protein from Proline to Alanine, and the Ala version has a reduced affinity for target genes, this means it binds to them less strongly and has a reduced effect on their expression.

It plays a crucial role in walking, running, and jumping by transmitting force from the calf muscles to the foot. Despite its strength, the Achilles tendon is vulnerable to injury due to limited blood supply, high mechanical stress, and genetic factors that influence tendon structure, collagen composition, and susceptibility to tendinopathy or rupture. Understanding your genetic predisposition can help you proactively strengthen and protect the Achilles tendon, reducing injury risk and improving performance.The results of your genetic test reveal to us that you may have a moderate risk of Achilles injury.",

Along with the PCL, MCL, and LCL, it helps control knee stability, movement, and force absorption during activities like running, jumping, and sudden directional changes. ACL injuries are often caused by sudden twisting or pivoting movements, rapid deceleration and stopping, direct impact to the knee (e.g., tackles, falls), and muscle imbalances or poor landing mechanics. Research indicates that genetics can influence ACL injury risk, likely through collagen structure, ligament elasticity, and inflammatory response.

There is a genetically determined difference in the degree of the IL-6 response to stressful stimuli between individuals, with the C allele found to be associated with significantly lower levels of plasma IL-6.GENEACTN3 - Alpha Actinin 3RS IDrs1815739GENOTYPETTAssociated with major structural component of the fast twitch fibres of skeletal muscles. Only present in fast twitch muscle fibres.GENETRIM63 (MuRF-1) - Muscle RING finger-1RS IDrs2275950GENOTYPETTMuscle RING finger-1 (MuRF-1) is known to be associated with cardiomyopathy and muscle atrophy (5), and it plays a crucial role in the ubiquitin proteasome system by attaching ubiquitin polymers to damaged myofibrillar proteins following EIMD, thus enabling the 26S-proteasome complex to degrade these ubiquitin-marked proteins. Mutations of this may decrease MuRF-1’s affinity for the titin strain-sensing kinase domain, thus reducing muscle fiber stiffness and increasing its susceptibility to exercise induced muscle damageGENECKM - Muscle-specific creatine kinaseRS IDrs8111989GENOTYPECCCKM gene is a muscle-specific form of CK, which catalyses the conversion of phospho-creatine (PCr) and ADP into creatine and ATP, as well as the reverse reaction. It is also an important gene because of its role in energy homeostasis in muscle cells. A genetic predisposition for low CKM activity could be an advantage for endurance performanceGENEAMDP1 - adenosylmethionine decarboxylase pseudogene 1RS IDrs17602729GENOTYPEGGThe AMPD1 gene encodes the enzyme adenosine monophosphate deaminase, which is one of the key enzymes used to process the energy source ATP. The C34T variation causes a premature stop in the protein, leading to a nonfunctional AMPD1 enzyme. Some individuals - but by no means all or even a majority apparently - who are AMPD1 deficient get muscle cramps and pains when they exert themselves. The most common genotype bringing this about is rs17602729(A;A), i.e. the individuals who carry two copies of the C34T allele and therefore have no functioning AMPD1 allele.GENEMLCK - Myosin Light Chain KinaseRS IDrs28497577GENOTYPEGGMyosin light chain kinase (MLCK) phosphorylates the regulatory light chain (RLC) of myosin producing increases in force development during skeletal muscle contraction. It has been suggested that MLCK gene polymorphisms might alter RLC phosphorylation thereby decreasing the ability to produce force and to resist strain during voluntary muscle contractions. Thus, the genetic variations in the MLCK gene might predispose some individuals to higher values of muscle damage during exercise, especially during endurance competitionsWhat does this mean? How can you action this idea?Personalised RecommendationsLeverage your genetic advantage by progressively increasing training intensity and frequency while ensuring proper recovery practices are still in place.Utilize post-workout recovery tools like stretching, hydration, and nutrient timing to further enhance muscle repair and performance gains.Incorporate periodized training programs, maximizing recovery efficiency to push performance boundaries without overtraining risks.Supplementation can still be beneficial, particularly for muscle recovery acceleration, cognitive function, and inflammation control (e.g., tart cherry extract, creatine, and collagen).What This Means For YouYour genetic profile suggests that you have a higher-than-",

    name: "Strength Response",
    text: "Strength is a critical component in sports such as weightlifting, gymnastics, CrossFit, and powerlifting. An individual's strength potential is primarily influenced by two factors: the size of muscle fibers recruited to generate force and the efficiency of neuromuscular activation. Genetic variations play a role in these factors, influencing muscle composition and recruitment patterns. Research has identified associations between specific genetic variants and strength levels, as well as their prevalence in elite strength athletes.The results of your genetic test reveal to us that you may have a moderate response to strength-based training.",

How can you action this idea?Personalised RecommendationsFollow a periodized strength program that cycles through different training phases, including strength (4-6 reps), hypertrophy (8-12 reps), and power (1-3 reps) to maximize gains.Incorporate compound exercises such as squats, deadlifts, bench presses, and overhead presses, which activate multiple muscle groups and improve overall strength.Monitor recovery through sleep tracking, mobility work, and proper nutrition, ensuring that muscle adaptation is maximized while minimizing the risk of overtraining.What This Means For YouYour genetic profile indicates a moderate response to strength training.You may possess a mix of genetic variants—some that enhance your response to strength training and others that may create limitations.With a well-structured training program, you can still achieve significant strength improvements regardless of genetic predisposition.Why This MattersA balanced training approach allows you to develop strength effectively while minimizing the risk of injury or plateauing.Combining endurance and strength training can lead to enhanced overall athletic performance, improving power, stability, and muscular endurance.Optimizing both genetic strengths and weaknesses through targeted training can ensure long-term progress and consistency.",
